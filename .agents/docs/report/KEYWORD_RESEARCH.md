# getmcp.es — Keyword Research Report

## 1. Executive Summary

getmcp.es currently ranks for **zero keywords** — the site is not indexed by Google. However, the MCP ecosystem is exploding (232% server growth, 97M+ monthly SDK downloads), and the keyword landscape is still immature enough for a well-positioned newcomer to capture significant long-tail traffic.

getmcp's strongest keyword opportunity is **not** "MCP server directory" (dominated by mcp.so, PulseMCP) but rather the **installation/configuration intent cluster** — "install MCP server," "sync MCP servers across apps," "[app] MCP setup" — where its unique 19-app, 4-format proposition perfectly matches search intent.

**Key insight:** 11 of 19 supported apps have virtually **zero competition** for their MCP setup keywords. Creating dedicated pages for these is almost guaranteed to rank.

**Strategy:** Don't try to outrank official repos. Instead, create the best **installation guide** for each server — "Install {Server} MCP Server in 19 AI Apps with One Command."

## 8. Winning Keyword Formula

Based on the full analysis, getmcp's optimal keyword formula is:

> **"[action verb] MCP server [in/across/for] [number] AI apps"**

Examples:

- "Install MCP servers across 19 AI apps"
- "Configure MCP server for Cursor, VS Code, and Claude"
- "Sync MCP servers in all your editors with one command"
- "Generate MCP config for 4 formats automatically"

This formula:

- Embeds the **primary keyword** ("MCP server")
- Highlights the **unique differentiator** (19 apps / 4 formats)
- Uses **action verbs** matching transactional intent
- Differentiates from competitors who focus on "browse" or "discover"

**Every title tag, H1, meta description, and CTA should use a variant of this formula.**
