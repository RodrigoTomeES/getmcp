## 1. Executive Summary

The current `getmcp.es` domain uses a Spain-locked ccTLD that limits organic search visibility to <1% of the MCP developer market. This report evaluates **28 alternative domains** across 2 brand families (`getmcp.*` and alternative names) and provides ranked purchase recommendations.

**Key findings:**

- The `getmcp.*` namespace is **heavily contested** — 7 domains are active projects, 6 are parked/for sale
- `getmcp.com` is **for sale** on GoDaddy/Afternic (make an offer)
- `getmcp.dev` is **owned by Postman** (redirects to their MCP explorer) — not available
- The best **unregistered opportunities** are in the `installmcp.*` and `universalmcp.dev` family
- `getmcp.co` is the most affordable "getmcp" branded domain currently for sale

### Tier 1: BEST OPTIONS (High brand value + Available)

| Rank  | Domain             | Why                                                                                                                              | Estimated Cost           | Action                                |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **getmcp.com**     | Strongest brand match. Universal trust. Direct brand continuity. `.com` is the gold standard.                                    | $500–$5,000 (negotiable) | Make offer on Afternic/GoDaddy        |
| **2** | **installmcp.com** | Descriptive + memorable. Keyword-rich ("install MCP"). Likely unregistered at standard price. Matches the product's core action. | ~$12/yr                  | Register immediately at any registrar |
| **3** | **installmcp.dev** | Same as above + `.dev` signals developer tool. HTTPS enforced by default. Google-owned TLD.                                      | ~$12/yr                  | Register immediately                  |

### Tier 2: STRONG ALTERNATIVES (Good brand + Available)

| Rank  | Domain               | Why                                                                                                      | Estimated Cost                | Action                         |
| ----- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **4** | **getmcp.co**        | Preserves "getmcp" brand. `.co` is popular startup TLD, globally treated. Cheaper than `.com`.           | $200–$2,000 (negotiable)      | Make offer on Afternic/GoDaddy |
| **5** | **universalmcp.dev** | Captures the "universal installer" positioning. Likely unregistered. `.dev` is perfect for the audience. | ~$12/yr                       | Register immediately           |
| **6** | **getmcp.app**       | Preserves brand. `.app` is Google-owned, HTTPS enforced. Parked at Porkbun — possibly cheap.             | $50–$500 (contact registrant) | Contact via Porkbun WHOIS      |
| **7** | **installmcp.io**    | Keyword-rich + `.io` is the dominant dev TLD. Likely unregistered.                                       | ~$35/yr                       | Register immediately           |

### Tier 3: VIABLE BUT LESS IDEAL

| Rank   | Domain               | Why                                                                              | Estimated Cost          | Action                               |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **8**  | **getmcp.net**       | Preserves brand. Listed on Sedo. `.net` is second-tier but globally treated.     | $100–$1,000 (Sedo)      | Make offer on Sedo                   |
| **9**  | **universalmcp.com** | Strong positioning keyword. For sale on Spaceship.                               | $500–$3,000 (negotiate) | Make offer on Spaceship              |
| **10** | **getmcp.xyz**       | Cheapest "getmcp" option. Parked at Porkbun. `.xyz` has slight spam association. | $20–$200                | Contact via Porkbun                  |
| **11** | **mcpinstall.dev**   | Inverted word order. Likely unregistered.                                        | ~$12/yr                 | Register if preferred                |
| **12** | **mcpconfig.io**     | Descriptive but narrower scope than "install". Likely unregistered.              | ~$35/yr                 | Register if pivoting to config focus |

### NOT RECOMMENDED

| Domain         | Reason                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| getmcp.dev     | Owned by Postman — impossible to acquire without corporate negotiation |
| getmcp.io      | Active open-source project — would create community conflict           |
| getmcp.cc      | Active commercial competitor ($19-$39)                                 |
| getmcp.site    | Active project                                                         |
| getmcp.org     | Active personal site                                                   |
| mcpinstall.com | Active competing directory                                             |
| mcpconfig.com  | Active competing site                                                  |
| getmcp.ai      | Unclear status, premium TLD pricing ($50-100+/yr)                      |
| getmcp.sh      | GitHub Pages 404 — owner intentions unclear                            |

## 4. Strategic Analysis

### 4.1 Brand Continuity vs. Fresh Brand

| Strategy                                         | Pros                                                                                          | Cons                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keep "getmcp" brand** (getmcp.com, .co, .app)  | No rebrand needed. npm packages already `@getmcp/cli`. GitHub repo matches. CLI name matches. | 4+ competing "getmcp" projects create brand confusion. Google may split authority. |
| **New descriptive brand** (installmcp.com, .dev) | Keyword-rich domain (SEO value). Clean namespace — no competitors. Describes the core action. | Requires rebrand of npm scope, GitHub repo. "installmcp" is longer to type.        |
| **Positioning brand** (universalmcp.dev)         | Captures unique selling point ("universal"). No competitors in namespace.                     | Longest to type. Doesn't match current npm scope. Less intuitive.                  |

**Recommendation:** Keep the "getmcp" brand if `getmcp.com` is affordable. The npm packages, CLI, and GitHub repo all use "getmcp" — rebranding has real cost. If `.com` is too expensive, `installmcp.dev` is the strongest alternative because it's descriptive, memorable, available at standard price, and captures the product's core action.

### 4.2 Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Option                          | Domain Cost | Rebrand Cost     | Total       | SEO Impact                      |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| **getmcp.com** (buy)            | $500–$5,000 | $0 (no rebrand)  | $500–$5,000 | Maximum — `.com` + brand match  |
| **installmcp.dev** (register)   | $12/yr      | ~8h rebrand work | $12 + labor | High — keyword-rich `.dev`      |
| **getmcp.co** (buy)             | $200–$2,000 | $0               | $200–$2,000 | Good — `.co` globally treated   |
| **universalmcp.dev** (register) | $12/yr      | ~8h rebrand work | $12 + labor | Good — positioning keyword      |
| **Stay on .es** (do nothing)    | $0          | $0               | $0          | Permanent handicap — Spain only |

### 4.3 The "getmcp" Brand Confusion Problem

There are now **7 active projects** sharing the "getmcp" name:

| Domain      | Product                                        | Relationship      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| getmcp.es   | Universal installer + directory (THIS PROJECT) | —                 |
| getmcp.dev  | Postman MCP Explorer (redirect)                | None              |
| getmcp.io   | Open Source MCP Registry                       | None              |
| getmcp.cc   | Paid desktop MCP installer ($19-$39)           | Direct competitor |
| getmcp.site | MCP Tools Platform                             | None              |
| getmcp.org  | Personal portfolio (unrelated)                 | None              |
| getmcp.app  | Parked (no content)                            | None              |

This fragmentation means:

1. Google splits brand authority across multiple domains
2. Users searching "getmcp" may land on the wrong project
3. `getmcp.cc` is a direct commercial competitor using nearly the same name

**Owning `getmcp.com` would consolidate brand authority.** If that's not possible, a distinctive alternative like `installmcp.dev` avoids the confusion entirely.

---

## 5. Migration Checklist

When migrating from `getmcp.es` to the new domain:

### Technical

- [ ] Set up 301 redirects from ALL `getmcp.es` URLs to equivalent new domain URLs
- [ ] Update canonical tags on all pages
- [ ] Update `hreflang` tags to reference new domain
- [ ] Resubmit sitemap in Google Search Console under new domain
- [ ] Use GSC "Change of Address" tool
- [ ] Update robots.txt on new domain
- [ ] Update all internal links
- [ ] Update JSON-LD `url` and `mainEntityOfPage` properties

### Ecosystem

- [ ] Update npm package `@getmcp/cli` homepage field
- [ ] Update GitHub repository URL and description
- [ ] Update all README files with new domain
- [ ] Update CLI cross-promotion messages
- [ ] Update any existing backlinks (reach out to sites that link to you)

### Verification

- [ ] Verify new domain in Google Search Console
- [ ] Verify new domain in Bing Webmaster Tools
- [ ] Monitor 301 redirect chain (no loops, no broken redirects)
- [ ] Monitor indexed page count on new domain (should recover within 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Keep `getmcp.es` redirects active for at least 12 months

---

## 6. Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Check registrar** for `installmcp.com` and `installmcp.dev` — if available, register both (~$24 total)
2. **Check registrar** for `universalmcp.dev` — if available, register it (~$12)
3. **Check pricing** for `getmcp.com` on Afternic/GoDaddy — if under $2,000, strongly consider purchasing

### Short-Term (Weeks 1-4)

4. **Make a decision**: Choose primary domain based on availability and budget
5. **Begin migration** following the checklist above
6. **Keep `getmcp.es` active** with 301 redirects for 12+ months

### Decision Framework

```
Is getmcp.com available for under $2,000?
  YES → Buy getmcp.com (best option, no rebrand needed)
  NO  → Is installmcp.com available at standard price?
          YES → Register installmcp.com + installmcp.dev
          NO  → Register universalmcp.dev
                or buy getmcp.co (if under $500)
```

## 7. Important Caveats

1. **WHOIS verification needed**: Domains marked "NOT RESOLVING" are _likely_ unregistered but could be registered with no DNS configured. Always verify through a registrar (Namecheap, Porkbun, Google Domains) before assuming availability.

2. **Price negotiation**: Domains on Afternic/Sedo/Spaceship typically sell for 10-50% of the initial asking price. Start with a low offer.

3. **`.dev` TLD advantage**: `.dev` domains enforce HTTPS (HSTS preloaded), are Google-owned, and are strongly associated with developer tools. At ~$12/year, they're the best value for developer-facing products.

4. **Timing matters**: The MCP ecosystem is growing 232% annually. Domain squatters are actively registering MCP-related domains. The longer you wait, the more expensive or unavailable options become.
